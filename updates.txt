<h4>Week of 6/8 to 6/12</h4>

<p>Hello, and I hope everyone has had a great weekend. The weather was fairly nice for me, so I hope yours was as well.

<p>As for me, I have been able to start coding on my own fully functional website.

<p>The following is the work I have done as of last week:
  -Started the basic Structure of Codeman's Hub.
  -Make all five relevant website files (for each page).
  -Design a Navbar that is compatible to mobile devices.

<p>As for the next steps for this week, my goals are as follows:
  -Finish the form for the contact page.
  -Use PHP processing to submit the form securely.
  -Start design on the About Me Page.
  -Work on structural designs for the homepage.

I hope you have a wonderful week of coding and fun!
